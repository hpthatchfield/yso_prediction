# yso_prediction

This is a work in progress, trying to practice machine learning project to identify YSOs from multi-wavelength observations of the CMZ.
This approach is intentionally naive, and I'm looking to apply the basics before trying anything fancier that might be more likely to have publishable results.
If you're interested in collaborating, please let me know! Happy to work with you whoever you are :)
